				This Plan of Subdivision was part of an assignment in the second semester of my third year,
				and was my introduction to AutoCAD. We weren't required to use AutoCAD, but I had grown tired of using
				LisCAD after nearly 3 years and was confident enough to give AutoCAD a try. How glad I am that I did!
				It was a great opportunity to see what more modern programs are capable of, such as giving me access to
				a command line right at my cursor along with tons of key combinations to switch between tools. Not that
				any of these are particularly revolutionary, but it was fun to get used to and allowed me to focus more
				on actually getting the work done rather than waste time fiddling with menus.
				<br> The assignment itself was straightforward: we were given the lot as a whole to subdivide, with a general
				design plan of how it should be divided. There were also some easements involved, and some details to fill in on
				a second sheet which I have excluded (It was mostly predefined how we were to fill it anyway). As usual, there's always
				slight design flaws which could be improved (in this case mostly to do with the awkward way I've represented some widths),
				but that's what learning experiences are for.
