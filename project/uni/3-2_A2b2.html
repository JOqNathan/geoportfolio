				The second boundary re-establishment project from second semester, third year also required drafting an
				Abstract of Field Records. This was the second time I made use of AutoCAD for drafting (the Plan of Subdivision
				project featured on this site was my first). With the density of information in this project, it took a lot of
				effort to tweak things around so everything was readable. I probably could have pushed a bit more into the open
				space of the roads, but of course I'm no design expert (much less so back then!). I'm still happy with how this
				turned out, and it was an absolute blast to use AutoCAD.
