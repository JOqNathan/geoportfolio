				This was the final submission in a multi-part direct link Street Alignment Reestablishment practical,
				from the first semester of my third year. This is a fairly basic map, but it was the first time in a while
				that I had done a full survey-style map. As you can see in this map (and many others), I often color-code elements
				wherever applicable. Since the map would normally be printed in monochrome, there's no harm in using colors to help
				keep things organized, right?
				<br> This was also one of the last times I would use LisCAD CAD to put together a map. I had been using it exclusively
				for these types of projects up until this point, since we were recommended to. I suppose there is some benefit in learning
				to use programs that aren't as user-friendly as is often expected in this day and age.
