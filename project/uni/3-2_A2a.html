				This was a big project from the second semester of my third year. While in retrospect, the basic principles
				of Crown Boundary Re-establishment aren't awfully complicated, it was certainly a lot to keep track of everything
				(and keep on track) in this project due to the several steps and calculations. This is a good example of how I tend to
				go quite far to ensure I can keep things organized. Since this was the first-of-its-kind project for me, I ended up
				developing the point marking system on the go alongside using color coding to ensure I always knew what information
				I had available.
				<br> As the above title implies, this was the first - not the only - project of its kind. With this as practice for knowing what I needed
				to track, I was able to make a much better organization system on the following Boundary Re-establishment project.
